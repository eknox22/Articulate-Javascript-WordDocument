# How to Use in Storyline:

Create a Text Entry field (e.g. name it TextEntry).

Create a True/False variable in Storyline called PasswordIsValid.

Trigger this JavaScript when the user clicks a button (e.g. “Submit”).

Add conditional triggers based on whether PasswordIsValid is true or false to provide feedback.
